# Cinnamon-Dark-Teal

A simple hybrid theme for **Linux Mint Cinnamon**!

I took the **Cinnamon** base theme (from **Linux Mint 22.2 Cinnamon**) and swapped in colors from **Mint-Y-Dark-Teal** theme (the variant included in **Linux Mint 22.2**) — just a personal experiment to see how it would look.

I have tested it on most desktop elements like the start menu, calendar, trays, audio/brightness controls, etc., and it looked good to me. But it might not be perfect in every dialog.
